I’m a computational linguist & information scientist, who researches abusive language detection, the creation of high-quality linguistic resources, and the development of socially responsible AI systems. My work combines computational methods with critical perspectives on language and harm, aiming to build systems that are both effective and ethically grounded.

**My Research Intersts**
* Abusive language & harmful content
* Corpus design & annotation methods
* Fairness, bias, and ethics in NLP
* Explainability and interpretability in language models
